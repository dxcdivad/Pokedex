#Pokedex

This is a simple front-end code challenge created to serve two purposes:
1. Show off your skills,
2. Give us a better understanding of your skills.

###Instructions
• Consume the public Pokedex API to retrieve a list of Pokemons.
• Display a grid of Pokemon.
• Allow selecting a Pokemon and show its individual data

###Optional
• Use a state management library (Redux, MobX, Unstated).
• Add pagination or infinite scrolling.
• Implement animated transitions.
• Route-based navigation.
• Flow or TypeScript annotations.
• Unit testing

You have ~1 hour to implement the basic Pokedex using React. You can start from scratch or you can use a
starter kit (i.e. create-react-app, Next.js). For the UI you can use whatever Material UI implementation you
prefer,

You're not expected to finish the tasks in the Optional section, like most real-world projects there are more
deliverables than time. As such we're not just interested in your code quality, but also in seeing how you
allocate limited resources, so choose wisely!
